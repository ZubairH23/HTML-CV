<hr/>
<body>
    <p>I am a author and a former architectural assistant, and I am now looking looking for a career in software development. I left the architectural field back in 2020 during the
        pandemic to pursue my dreams of being an author and after 4 years I decided that I want to start a new chapter in Tech.</p><br> <p>I consider myself to be both effcient and highly organised. One skill that I
        value within myself is that I can become very interpersonal with people, working in both a team setting
        and a individual one and always eager to step outside my comfort zone.</p><br> <p>I'm punctual, hard working,
        honest and always aim to bring out the best in whatever situation that I'm in. I consider myself to be
        quick on my feet and always ready to take up an opportunity to broaden my skills and knowledge.</p><br> <p>I
        enjoy solving problems through creative design. My end goal is to be a chartered Quantity Surveyor
        and help bring many exciting projects to life.</p>
